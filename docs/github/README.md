# Setup GITHUB

Git is already installed in Ubuntu. This page is about how to add GITHUB UserName and PERSONAL TOKEN as envionment variables

## Why do we need this?
Github Personal Token is used for authenticating with Github.

## How do you add personal token and make it available in the system

* Create a new personal token [Official Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)

TODO
Github credentials follow [billime](https://github.com/billimek/k8s-gitops/blob/master/setup/add-repo-key.sh). Not sure if this needs a visit later but for now ok with this setup
